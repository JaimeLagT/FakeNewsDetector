Fake News Detector
# 🔍 Fake News Detector

A machine learning web application that detects fake news articles using a hybrid approach combining pre-trained models and custom features.

## 🎯 Project Goal

Learn ML fundamentals while building a practical fake news detection system over 8 weeks.

## 📊 Current Status

**Week 1**: Setting up foundation with pre-trained models
- [x] Repository created
- [ ] Basic pre-trained model integration
- [ ] Simple web interface

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Planned)

- Python, Flask
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Scikit-learn
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## 📈 Development Plan

Following an 8-week progressive learning approach:
- **Weeks 1-2**: Pre-trained models
- **Weeks 3-4**: Feature engineering  
- **Weeks 5-6**: Custom ML models
- **Weeks 7-8**: Integration & deployment
